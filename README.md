LMS SYSTEM
This repository contains a GUI-based Learning Management System (LMS) developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system provides a graphical user interface for managing multiple user roles, including Admin, Instructor, and Student, each with role-specific functionalities such as course creation, instructor assignment, student enrollment, assignment posting and submission, grading, attendance tracking, and announcements. The project implements core OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and uses both text files and binary random-access files for persistent data storage. This LMS is designed as an academic project to demonstrate GUI application development, structured system design, and efficient data management in C++.
